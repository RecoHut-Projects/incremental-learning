Occasionally, a Level 1 update will reset the whole model (both global model and all per-key components); this will be a batch offline update using a large accumulated dataset. More frequently, Level 2 updates will reset just the per-key components; this again will be an offline batch update, but won’t touch the large global model. Finally, “lightweight” Level 3 updates will occur almost continuously; any individual per-key component is tuned as soon as there is enough data to do so."]}]}
